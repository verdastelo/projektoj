Q&A

1. What is the difference between floats and doubles? (Must have something to do with memory.) 
2. What is initialization? (Declaring a variable and assinging a value to it.) 
3. The initialization statement "int x = 1.1" is illegal. Why does not an error display when it is compiled? (Conversion?)
4. Why compiling "double y = 1/3" gives 0? 
5. How does a computer adds, subtracts, divides, and multiplies floating point numbers? 
6. How to use typecast to convert between types? (Mention the syntax.) 
7. What is the syntax of a function? 
8. What is a class definition? 
9. Parameters and arguments are different. Describe. 
10. Are voit main() and int main() different? 
11. Look up state digram. 
12. Expand 'Each time a function is called, it creates a new instance of that function.' 
13. Declare the type of each parameter but do not declare the type of each argument. 
14.

1. Logarithms (Better Explained) 
2. Trigonometry 
3. 



Notes

1. For every type in C++, there is a corresponding type that typecasts its argument to the appropriate type.
